          <br>
            <li>it is the largest city in the region known as Malabar and was the capital of the British-era Malabar district. In antiquity and the medieval period, Kozhikode was dubbed the City of Spices for its role as the major trading point for Indian spices.It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins). The port at Kozhikode acted as the gateway to medieval South Indian coast for the Chinese, the Arabs, the Portuguese, the Dutch and finally the British.</li>
         <br>
            <li>Although the city's official name is Kozhikode, in English it is sometimes known by its anglicised version, Calicut.The word calico, a fine variety of hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from the port of Kozhikode, is thought to have been derived from Calicut.It is the historical capital of Kerala as the history dates back to 1498 AD when Vasco da Gama landed in Koyilandy, near Calicut</li>
